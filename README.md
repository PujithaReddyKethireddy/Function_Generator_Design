Analog Function Generator:
Project Overview:
This project involves the design and simulation of an analog function generator capable of producing:
Sine
Square
Triangular
Pulse waveforms
The generator allows adjustable amplitude and frequency, making it useful for signal testing in labs, education, and basic circuit development.

Tools Used:
LTSpice – for circuit simulation
Proteus – for PCB layout and testing

Circuit Description:
The design includes:
Wien Bridge Oscillator
Astable Multivibrator
Comparator Circuit
Integrator
Op-Amps and Passive Components (R, C)

All waveforms are generated using only analog components, without any microcontroller.

Simulation Results:
Simulated all four waveforms with amplitude and frequency variation
Verified using oscilloscope outputs (in Proteus) and also in real time
