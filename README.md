🎛️ Analog Function Generator – 19ECE384 Open Lab Project
📌 Project Overview
This project involves the design and simulation of an analog function generator capable of producing:

Sine

Square

Triangular

Pulse waveforms

The generator allows adjustable amplitude and frequency, making it useful for signal testing in labs, education, and basic circuit development.

🛠 Tools Used
LTSpice – for circuit simulation

Proteus – for PCB layout and testing

⚙️ Circuit Description
The design includes:

Wien Bridge Oscillator

Astable Multivibrator

Comparator Circuit

Integrator

Op-Amps and Passive Components (R, C)

All waveforms are generated using only analog components, without any microcontroller.

🧪 Simulation Results
Simulated all four waveforms with amplitude and frequency variation

Verified using oscilloscope outputs (in Proteus)
